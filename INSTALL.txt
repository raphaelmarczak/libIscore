The libIscore library run under Mac OS X 10.4 10.5 and 10.6.

Before compiling (using gcc 4.2 or earlier version), you will need to install:

- gecode-3.2.0 framework (http://www.gecode.org)
- Qt (4.0 or earlier version) (http://qt.nokia.com/products/platform/qt-for-mac)

Then type:
make
make install

make install will copy the library libIscore.a in /usr/local/lib and the main header Engines.hpp in /usr/local/include/IScore. It will also copy the network plugins in /Library/Application\ Support/Virage/
